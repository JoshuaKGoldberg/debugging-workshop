# Debugging Workshop

Let's dive into debugging broken(-ish) code! ðŸ™Œ

This workshop will guide you through a set of strategies you can use to figure out why things aren't working the way you want.
Each strategy is useful only sometimes: part of getting good at debugging is knowing how to pick one (and when to switch to another).

## Setup

```shell
npm i
```

## Ground Rules

- Please ask questions! Let me know if any of this isn't making sense, because if it's not for you, you're never the only one!
- Everybody learns at their own pace. It's absolutely fine to not get it immediately.

## Workshop Steps

To run an individual step's tests, run `npm run test -- ` and the workshop number.
For example, running the first step's tests:

```shell
npm run test -- 1
```

1. [Thinking Deeply](./src/1-thinking-deeply)
1. [Console Logs](./src/2-console-logs)
1. [Breakpoints](3-breakpoints)
