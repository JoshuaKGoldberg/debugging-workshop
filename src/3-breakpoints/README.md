# 3. Breakpoints ‚úã

Using a _debugger_ means some tool -such as your editor- is running code and has the ability to _pause the code_ so you can _inspect values_.
You can tell it to pause code when it reaches a line by putting a üî¥ breakpoint on that line.
The editor will pause your code _just_ before it would run that line.

Once a breakpoint is hit, you can:

- Use the visual tools in the editor to see all the values of variables
- Use the _Debug Terminal_ to execute any code you want to run
- Step forward a line (‚û°Ô∏è) or continue execution (‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
- Feel really good about yourself: you're doing fancy debugger stuff!
