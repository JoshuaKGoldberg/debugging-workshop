# 2. Console Logs ðŸªµ

You don't need to learn about "debuggers" to debug your code.
Logging values is totally reasonable and I do it all the time.

Try to think about what values might be useful to know when debugging.
Then, instead of assuming they're what you expect, `console.log` them.

> Tip: instead of `console.log("value is:", value)`, you can use syntax like `console.log({ value })` to log an object like `{ value: value }`. ðŸ’¡
